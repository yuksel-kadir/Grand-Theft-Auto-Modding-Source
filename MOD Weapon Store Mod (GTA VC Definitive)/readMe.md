### INSTALLATION

- Download "**weapon_store[mem].js**" file and "**weapon_store_exports**" folder.
- Paste the file and the folder into the **CLEO** folder("**..\GTA Vice City Definitive Edition Install Location\Gameface\Binaries\Win64\CLEO**").

### CONTROLS

- Press "**E**" key to **open up** the weapon store menu.
- Press "**E**" key to **close** the weapon store menu.
- Press "**SHIFT**" key to **buy** the selected weapon.
- Press "**A**", "**D**", or "**Left Arrow**", "**Right Arrow**" to scroll through the weapons.

### PROBLEMS

- _**DO NOT** stand in the pink marker and press "E" key while you're in the weapon shop_.
- Some of the gxt keys **do not exist** in the game files. So if you see a text like "... **missing!**" over the weapons while buying a weapon **don't worry**(_Example: "Molotov missing!"_).
